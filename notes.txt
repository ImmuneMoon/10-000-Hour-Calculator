A calculator for determining how many hours you have left to 
reach 10,000 hours in a skill. The calculator will tell you
how many hours you have left based on how many hours a day
you practice a skill, and how many days a week you practice.

For Example:
2hrs a day x 7 days a week x 52.143 weeks a year (730.002)
(or 4.345 weeks a month x 12 months(729.96)) divide 10,000 
by the quotient (10,000 / 730.002) will give you 
the time (round up) it will take to master the skill 
(13.7 years in this case).

Could try and make it more nuanced like specifying how many 
weeks a month you practice, and more nuanced to how many 
months in a year you practice.

But the simplest would be the former. To implement the latter
would be more complicated and needs more planning. A solution 
that integrates this could allow for the user to input at least 
the hours, but make the rest optional. The program will 
then perform the calculation with defaults that assume 7 days 
a week, and 52.143 weeks in a year.

Could implement the former first and progress to including 
the latter over never versions.

I would also like to implement another function that appears
after the first calculation is done which allows you to 
input how many years you would like it to take and it will tell 
you how many hours a day you need to practice and assume 7 days
a week, 52.143 weeks a year. (Possibly) With the option to 
additionally input how many weeks a month you want to practice?

Could additionally have a function that allows you to create a 
weekly schedule for practicing.
